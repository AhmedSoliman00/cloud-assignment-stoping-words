# Stop Words Removal Program

This Python program demonstrates how to remove stop words from a text using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library.

## Description

The program reads the contents of a text file and removes common stop words from the text. Stop words are words that are considered unimportant or redundant in natural language processing tasks, such as "the", "is", "and", etc.

## Features

- Removes stop words from the text.
- Counts the frequency of each word in the processed text.

## Installation

1. Install Python if not already installed. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Install NLTK library using the following command:
   ```
   pip install nltk
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a text file containing the text from which you want to remove stop words. You can use any text file format (e.g., .txt).

2. Run the Python script `remove_stop_words.py` by executing the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   python remove_stop_words.py
   ```



3. The program will process the text, remove stop words, count word frequencies, and display the results.

## Example

Suppose we have a text file named `example.txt` containing the following text:
```
This is an example sentence. It contains some stop words like the, is, and it.
```

After running the program, the output will be:
```
Word Frequency Count:
example: 1
sentence: 1
contains: 1
like: 1
```
